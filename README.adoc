= module-used-by

[WARNING]
====
This repository is beta software.
====

The purpose of this pre-commit hook is narrow.
The goal is to ensure that Asciidoc (.adoc) files in the `modules` directory of the `openshift-docs` repo are updated with the names of the assembly AsciiDoc files that reference them.

== Installation

See link:https://pre-commit.com[pre-commit] for instructions.

Sample `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
- repo: https://github.com/mikemckiernan/module-used-by
  rev: v0.1.0
  hooks:
  - id: module-used-by
    types: [asciidoc]

== Limitations

=== Other information in a module-used-by block comment

Comments at the end of the module-used-by block comment are not preserved.
If the comment block ends like the following example, then the hook deletes last two lines of the comment.

.Sample input for a comment block with trailing information
[source,asciidoc,highlight="4,5"]
----
...
// * cookies/holiday/gingerbread.adoc
// * cookies/chocolate-chip.adoc
//
// Bread recipes link to this; do not change anchor
----

.Sample output with the trailing information deleted
[source,asciidoc]
----
...
// * cookies/holiday/gingerbread.adoc
// * cookies/chocolate-chip.adoc
----

=== Comments before the module-used-by block comment

If the module-used-by block comment is preceded by another comment, the hook deletes the first comment and then inserts the module-used-by block comment.
As a result, the hook leaves the file with the original module-used-by comment block as the second comment, or in any subsequent position.

.Sample input for a preceding comment block
[source,asciidoc,highlight="1..3"]
----
// TODO -  possibly delete this file
// Or does someone want anchovy-and-anise-flavored cookies?

// Module included in the following assemblies:

.Sample output with the first comment block deleted
